# runtime-output-format Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change support-selectable-runtime-output-format. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Native runtime calls support caller-selected output formats
The public NX native runtime SHALL allow hosts to request either MessagePack or JSON from
value-returning runtime calls on a per-call basis. The selected format SHALL apply to both
successful result payloads and diagnostic payloads returned for that call.

#### Scenario: Source evaluation returns JSON directly
- **WHEN** a host evaluates `let root() = { 42 }` and requests JSON output
- **THEN** the runtime SHALL return the UTF-8 JSON payload `42`
- **AND** SHALL NOT require a separate MessagePack-to-JSON conversion call

#### Scenario: Program-artifact evaluation returns JSON diagnostics directly
- **WHEN** a host evaluates a previously built `ProgramArtifact`, the call fails with diagnostics,
  and the host requests JSON output
- **THEN** the runtime SHALL return a UTF-8 JSON diagnostics array for that failed call
- **AND** SHALL NOT return MessagePack diagnostics for that request

#### Scenario: MessagePack output remains available
- **WHEN** a host evaluates NX source or a previously built `ProgramArtifact` and requests
  MessagePack output
- **THEN** the runtime SHALL return the existing canonical MessagePack payload for that call
