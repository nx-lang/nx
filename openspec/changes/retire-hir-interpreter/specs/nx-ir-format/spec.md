## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A conformance corpus defines NX IR behavior
The repository SHALL hold a corpus of NX programs, each with its expected artifact for every emitted
module, the explained text of each expected artifact, and its expected evaluation results for every
entrypoint the corpus names. A corpus program MAY also name component lifecycles: a component to
initialize, optional props, and ordered batches to dispatch against it, whose entries are written
as a host would send them, handler tokens included. The expected results SHALL then record the
rendered output of initialization and, for each batch in turn, the rendered output and the ordered
effects, all as canonical values with their handler tokens, as the Rust IR runtime produces them.
The expected results are committed data: a regeneration that changes one SHALL be a reviewed change
of behavior, and the emitter's tests SHALL fail when a committed result differs from what the Rust
IR runtime produces. The emitter's tests SHALL check that each program emits its expected artifact
byte for byte, SHALL report a difference as explained text, and SHALL check that each committed
explained text is the explanation of its committed artifact. Every supported runtime SHALL check that it evaluates each
expected artifact to the expected results, lifecycles included. One regeneration command SHALL
write the artifacts, their explained text and the expected results together. The corpus SHALL cover
every node kind, type kind and declaration kind, cross-artifact references, and a program emitted
without its debug section. For every corpus program, the artifact emitted without a debug section
SHALL be at most six times the UTF-8 length of the program's own module source.

#### Scenario: Emitter output is pinned by the corpus
- **WHEN** the emitter is changed so that a corpus program's artifact differs
- **THEN** the emitter's corpus test SHALL fail naming the program and the difference as explained
  text

#### Scenario: A change to the emitter is readable in review
- **WHEN** the emitter is changed so that a corpus program's artifact differs
- **AND** the corpus is regenerated
- **THEN** both the image and its explained text SHALL be updated
- **AND** the explained text's diff SHALL name what changed about the program

#### Scenario: Stale explained text is caught
- **WHEN** a corpus image is committed without regenerating its explained text
- **THEN** the emitter's corpus test SHALL fail naming the program

#### Scenario: A runtime is checked against the corpus
- **WHEN** a runtime evaluates a corpus artifact's named entrypoint
- **THEN** its canonical value SHALL equal the expected result recorded for it

#### Scenario: A runtime's dispatch is checked against the corpus
- **WHEN** a runtime initializes a corpus lifecycle's component and dispatches its batches in order
- **THEN** each rendered output, its tokens included, and each effect list SHALL equal the values
  recorded for it

#### Scenario: The size budget is enforced
- **WHEN** a corpus program of 8,000 bytes of source is emitted without a debug section
- **THEN** the artifact SHALL be at most 48,000 bytes
