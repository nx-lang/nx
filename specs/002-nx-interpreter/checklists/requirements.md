# Specification Quality Checklist: NX Interpreter

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality Assessment**:
- ✅ Spec avoids implementation details - focuses on capabilities like "System MUST execute" and "System MUST evaluate"
- ✅ Focused on developer productivity through ability to execute and test NX functions
- ✅ Written in plain language understandable by non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Dependencies) are complete

**Requirement Completeness Assessment**:
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are specific and actionable
- ✅ Requirements are testable - each FR can be verified (e.g., "MUST execute HIR instructions" can be tested with sample functions)
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., "100% of arithmetic operations", "under 100 milliseconds", "recursive calls up to depth 100")
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic - describe outcomes without specifying Rust implementation details
- ✅ All acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format and are specific
- ✅ Edge cases cover important boundary conditions (no return statement, infinite loops, wrong parameter count, null values, recursion)
- ✅ Scope is clearly bounded - focuses only on HIR interpretation, explicitly notes no I/O or external calls in MVP
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions sections clearly identify prerequisites (nx-hir, nx-diagnostics, nx-types) and constraints

**Feature Readiness Assessment**:
- ✅ Each functional requirement maps to user stories and success criteria
- ✅ Four user stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3, P2), appropriately reflecting their importance
- ✅ Success criteria align with user stories - each story has corresponding measurable outcomes
- ✅ No implementation details leak into specification (mentions "HIR" which is the abstraction layer, not Rust-specific implementation)

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification is complete, focused, and ready for implementation planning. All requirements are testable, measurable, and technology-agnostic (within the constraints of working with NX HIR). The scope is clearly bounded to a simple interpreter MVP.

**Next Steps**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create the implementation plan.
