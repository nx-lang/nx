# Specification Quality Checklist: Core NX Parsing and Validation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Updated**: 2025-10-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**2025-10-26 Update**: Specification successfully updated to focus only on core Rust-based parsing and validation functionality. All IDE integration aspects have been removed and will be covered in a separate spec.

**Content Quality Assessment**:
- ✅ Spec avoids implementation details in requirements - focuses on capabilities like "System MUST parse" and "System MUST validate"
- ✅ Focused on developer productivity through error detection and type checking
- ✅ Written in plain language understandable by non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete with concrete details

**Requirement Completeness Assessment**:
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are specific and actionable
- ✅ Requirements are testable - each FR can be verified (e.g., "MUST parse valid NX syntax" can be tested with sample files)
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., "10,000 lines per second", "within 2 seconds", "100% of type mismatches")
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic - describe outcomes without specifying tools or frameworks
- ✅ All acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format and are specific
- ✅ Edge cases cover important boundary conditions (large files, mixed valid/invalid syntax, circular dependencies, incomplete files)
- ✅ Scope is clearly bounded - focuses only on parsing and type checking, explicitly excludes IDE and CLI integration
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions sections clearly identify prerequisites and constraints

**Feature Readiness Assessment**:
- ✅ Each functional requirement maps to user stories and success criteria
- ✅ Both user scenarios are P1 priority, appropriately reflecting their core nature
- ✅ Success criteria align with user stories - each story has corresponding measurable outcomes
- ✅ No implementation details leak into specification

## Scope Changes from Original Spec

**Removed**:
- User Story 1: Syntax Highlighting (IDE feature - moved to separate spec)
- User Story 3: Language Server Features (IDE feature - moved to separate spec)
- User Story 5: Code Formatting (IDE feature - moved to separate spec)
- All IDE-specific functional requirements (FR-002, FR-004, FR-010, FR-014, FR-015 from original)
- All Language Server Protocol and VS Code dependencies

**Retained**:
- User Story 2 (now Story 1): Parse and Validate NX Files
- User Story 4 (now Story 2): Check Types and Semantics
- Core parsing and type checking functional requirements
- Library API focus rather than CLI/IDE integration

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification is now tightly focused on core parsing and validation capabilities implemented in Rust. The scope is clearly bounded to exclude IDE integration, which will be a separate feature. All requirements are testable, measurable, and technology-agnostic (in the requirements section).

**Next Steps**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create the implementation plan.
